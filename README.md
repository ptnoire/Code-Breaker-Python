# Code-Breaker
## Written in Python

## This tiny game is built simply in Python, I always like to keep these projects just as a reminder of languages I've used or for when I forget that I've ever used them based on the main language I'm using at the time.

Or maybe just to look back on the things I used to find incredible when I was new.
